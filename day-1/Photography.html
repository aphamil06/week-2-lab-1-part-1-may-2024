    <p>I <em>love</em> photography!!  Being able to capture some of life's most precious memories to be able to go back and look at is absolutely magical.  I enjoy looking at old photos of great moments.</p>
    
    <h2> How I got started with photography</h2>
    <p>I have always loved taking photos.  I just started taking photos with my phone, and people loved them.  I also loved the quality of the photos, but I wanted more.  So I invested in a DSLR camera, and I never looked back since.  Now i'm able to take full control of the photos that I take and have them come out looking <strong>exactly</strong> how i had in my mind for them to look. </p>
