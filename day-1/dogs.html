    Dogs

  <p>I like dogs. They are so very smart and I think they make great pets and companions.  Dogs are <em>especially</em> great for people who are lonely as they are great at keeping you company.  Dogs are all around <strong>awesome</strong> and make great pets for anyone who love them.</p>

    Dogs also have <strong>wonderful</strong> senses.  They can pick up on things that <em>humans</em> can't usually pick up on naturally.  They can hear very well, and they're also great at sniffing. </p>
    <p>Overall, dogs are just super awesome and a joy to have around.  If you're good to a dog, the dog will be good to you.  Thank you for reading this.  </p>
